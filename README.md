## Difficulty Levels
This game comes with 3 difficulty levels

* **easy:** The bot just picks a field randomly. This makes it really easy for the player to win.
* **medium:** The bot chooses either a random field or if the bot or player needs a field to win, it chooses that field. This makes it more difficult, but still winnable.
* **impossible:** The bot uses the Minimax algorithm for every choose of its field. This makes it impossible to win. The player either makes a draw or loses.
