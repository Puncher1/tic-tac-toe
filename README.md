## Difficulty Levels
This game comes with 3 difficulty levels

* **easy:** The "AI" (if you still can tell this AI) just picks a field randomly. This makes it really easy for the player to win.
* **medium:** The AI randomly (chance of 50/50) chooses either a random field or it uses the minimax algorithm to choose its field. This makes it more difficult, but still winnable.
* **impossible:** The AI uses the minimax algorithm for every choose of its field. This makes it impossible to win. The player either makes a draw or loses.
